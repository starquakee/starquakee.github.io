# About Me

Hello! My name is Chenchen Feng, and I am a second-year graduate student specializing in Computer Science. I am interested in Evolutionary Computation, Backend and LLM. I love playing games. At the same time, I am a homebody, love ACG, have seen 500+ animations and played over 100 GalGames. If you also love ACG, please add me as a [bangumi friend](https://bangumi.tv/user/846860).
