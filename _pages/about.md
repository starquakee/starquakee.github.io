# About Me

Hello! My name is Chenchen Feng, and I am a first-year graduate student specializing in Computer Science. I am interested in Evolutionary Computation and specialize in designing Differential Evolution algorithms. I love playing games and am a top 100 player in CR and COC. At the same time, I am a homebody, love ACG, have seen 300+ animations and played over 100 Galgames. If you also love ACG, please add me as a [bangumi friend](https://bangumi.tv/user/846860).
