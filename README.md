# Updating

## Running locally

When you are initially working your website, it is very useful to be able to preview the changes locally before pushing them to GitHub. To work locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above.
1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed
    
    On most Linux distribution and [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) the command is:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs
    ```
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.
