The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. When given an undirected graph, the objective need to find a minimum cost set of tours that services a subset of edges with positive demand under capacity constraints. In this paper, path-scanning algorithm with local searching function is implemented based on Python to solve this problem. Based on path-scanning as main framework, the algorithm adopts random path scanning and flip to solve the optimal solutions of NP-hard problems.
