The Open Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (OCARP) is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem where, given an undirected graph, the objective is to find a minimum cost set of tours that services a subset of edges with positive demand under capacity constraints. In this paper, a path-scanning algorithm with local searching function is implemented based on Python to solve this problem. Based on path-scanning as a framework, the algorithm adopts random path scanning and genetic scanning to solve the optimal solutions of NP-hard problems.

In order to solve capacitated arc routing problem, I first used the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path two-dimensional array of the whole graph. Then, path-scanning algorithm is used to search for the Path that meets the conditions and is closest to the current point each time, combined with random algorithm and genetic mutation to find a short path in capacitated arc routing problem which is a NP problem.
